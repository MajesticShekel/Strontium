# SciRender
A rendering engine I'm working on using OpenGL. I started working on this
project to learn computer graphics and GPU parallelism. Currently a WIP with
very few features and no planned features.

I eventually plan to use this as the frontend for
[FinDPyNe](https://github.com/ksawatzky777/FinDPyNE), replacing the PyGame
GUI that it currently uses.

If you want to download and run the skeleton of an application that is SciRender,
follow the steps below:
1. Download and install GL, GLU, GLEW, GLFW and GLM.
2. Download and install make (the build system SciRender uses) and git
(version control).
3. Run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ksawatzky777/SciRender.git
cd SciRender
make
./Application
```
